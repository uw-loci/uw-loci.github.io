LOCI creates [open source scientific software](/oss). While a central
motivation is to facilitate development of computational techniques for imaging
and manipulating living specimens, our software efforts are broader in scope,
with the goal of benefiting the entire scientific community.

This website houses LOCI's software articles:

* [Developing LOCI Software](/developing-loci-software) -
  a primer for LOCI programmers
* [Open Source in Science](/oss) -
  LOCI's philosophy on software development
* [Why Java?](/why-java) -
  why LOCI uses the Java platform
* [Interfacing From Non-Java Code](/interfacing-non-java-code) -
  connecting Java programs across language boundaries
* [Debugging Techniques](/debugging-techniques) -
